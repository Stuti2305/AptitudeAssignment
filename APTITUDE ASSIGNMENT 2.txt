APTITUDE ASSIGNMENT 2

1. What quantity of water should be added to the milk water mixture so that
the milk water ratio changes from 2:3 to 4:11. The quantity of milk in the
mixture is 40 litres?

Let the quantity of water to be added be x litres. The ratio of milk and water in the mixture is 2:3. Therefore, the quantity of milk in the mixture is 40 litres and the quantity of water is 60 litres.
we need to add x litres of water to the mixture so that the ratio of milk and water becomes 4:11. Therefore, the quantity of milk in the new mixture will be (40/5) * 4 = 32 litres and the quantity of water will be (60+x)/5 * 11 = (660+11x)/5 litres.

Since we are adding only water, we can say that:

(660+11x)/5 = x + 60

Solving for x, we get:

x = 20 litres

Therefore, we need to add 20 litres of water to the mixture so that the milk-water ratio changes from 2:3 to 4:11.

2. Linear equation 2x+3y=0 meets the x & y-axis at the point?

The given linear equation is 2x + 3y = 0. To find the point where the line intersects the x-axis, we substitute y = 0 in the equation and solve for x. Therefore:

2x + 3(0) = 0

2x = 0

x = 0

So the point where the line intersects the x-axis is (0, 0). Similarly, to find the point where the line intersects the y-axis, we substitute x = 0 in the equation and solve for y. Therefore:

2(0) + 3y = 0

3y = 0

y = 0

So the point where the line intersects the y-axis is (0, 0)

3. a & b are positive integers such that a^2-b^=19. Find a & b?

The given equation is a^2 - b^2 = 19. We can factorize this equation as follows:

(a + b)(a - b) = 19

Since 19 is a prime number, the only possible values for (a + b) and (a - b) are 19 and 1 respectively. Therefore:

a + b = 19

a - b = 1

Solving these equations simultaneously gives us:

a = 10

b = 9

Therefore, the values of a and b are 10 and 9 respectively
===========================================================================
4. Find a^+b^3+c^3+3abc , where a+b+c=5 & , a^2+b^2+c^2=10?

We have two equations:

a + b + c = 5

a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 10

We can use the identity (a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) to find a^3 + b^3 + c^3:

(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a)

Substituting the given values of a + b + c and a^2 + b^2 + c^2, we get:

125 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a)

125 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(ab(a+b) + bc(b+c) + ca(c+a))

125 = a^3+b^3+c^3+3abc(a+b+c)

Substituting the given values of a+b+c and a^2+b^2+c^2, we get:

125 = a^3+b^3+c^3+15abc

Therefore,

a^3+b^3+c^3+3abc = 125 - 12abc

Now we need to find the value of abc. We can use the identity (a - b)^2+(b - c)^2+(c - a)^2=2(a^2+b^2+c^2-(ab+bc+ca)) to find ab+bc+ca:

(a - b)^2+(b - c)^2+(c - a)^2=2(a^2+b^2+c^2-(ab+bc+ca))

Substituting the given values of a+b+c and a^2+b^2+c^2, we get:

18 = 2(10 - (ab+bc+ca))

9 = 5 - ab - bc - ca

ab+bc+ca = 4

Now we can substitute this value into our expression for a^3+b^3+c^3+3abc:

a^3+b^3+c^3+3abc = 125 - 12abc

a^3+b^3+c^3+12(ab+bc+ca) = 173

Substituting the given value of ab+bc+ca, we get:

a^3+b^3+c^3+48 = 173

a^3+b^3+c^3 = 125

Therefore,

a ^ 1/1+b ^ 1/1+c ^ 1/1=5/1

a ^ 1/1*b ^ 1/1*c ^ 1/1=4/1[^5]

5. Sum of two, two-digit numbers is a perfect square. The digits of the first
two-digit number are two consecutive positive integers; also, when the digits
of the first number are reversed, the second number is formed. Find these
numbers & the square root of their sum.

Let the two-digit number be 10a + b, where a and b are consecutive positive integers. Then the other two-digit number is 10b + a. The sum of these two numbers is:

(10a + b) + (10b + a) = 11(a + b)

Since the sum of two two-digit numbers is a perfect square, 11(a + b) must be a perfect square. The only perfect squares less than 100 that are divisible by 11 are 121 and 484. Therefore:

11(a + b) = 121 or 11(a + b) = 484

If 11(a + b) = 121, then a + b = 11. The possible values of a and b are (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7), (7,8), (8,9), and (9,10). The corresponding two-digit numbers are 12, 23, 34, 45, 56, 67, 78, 89, and 90. Reversing the digits of each of these numbers gives the other two-digit number. For example, reversing the digits of 12 gives 21.

If 11(a + b) = 484, then a + b = 44. The only possible values of a and b are (1,43) and (43,1). The corresponding two-digit numbers are 14 and 41.

Therefore, the two-digit numbers are either 12 and 21, 23 and 32, â€¦, or 14 and 41. The sum of these numbers is:

12 + 21 = 33

23 + 32 = 55

34 + 43 = 77

45 + 54 = 99

56 + 65 =121

67 +76 =143

78+87=165

89+98=187

14+41=55

The square root of their sum is:

sqrt(33+55+77+99+121+143+165+187+55)=sqrt(935)

Therefore,

the two-digit numbers are either:

12 and 21
23 and 32
34 and 43
45 and 54
56 and 65
67 and 76
78 and 87
89 and 98
14 and 41
and the square root of their sum is approximately equal to 30.5778.
