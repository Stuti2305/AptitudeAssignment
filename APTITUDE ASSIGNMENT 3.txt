APTITUDE ASSIGNMENT 3

1. Write two quadratic equations such that the sum of roots equals twice the
product of roots?
Let the roots of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 be α and β. Then:
α + β = -b/a
αβ = c/a
We want to find two quadratic equations such that the sum of roots equals twice the product of roots. That is:
α + β = 2αβ
Substituting the expressions for α + β and αβ from above, we get:
-b/a = 2c/a
Simplifying this equation, we get:
b = -2c
Therefore, two quadratic equations that satisfy the given condition are:
x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0
and
x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0
The sum of roots of each equation is:
α + β = -b/a = -2/(1) = -2
The product of roots of each equation is:
αβ = c/a = 1/(1) = 1
Therefore, the sum of roots of each equation is twice the product of roots.

2. 2x+3y=12 has (2,3) as its solution or not?

To check whether (2,3) satisfies the equation 2x+3y=12, we substitute x=2 and y=3 in the equation:

2(2) + 3(3) = 4 + 9 = 13

Therefore, (2,3) does not satisfy the equation 2x+3y=12.

3. Find possible coordinates of (x,y) such that point (1,1), (2,2) & (x,y) are collinear?

To find possible coordinates of (x,y) such that point (1,1), (2,2) & (x,y) are collinear, we can use the collinear points formula.

The formula is:

(y2− y1)(x3− x2) = (y3− y2)(x2− x1)

where (x1,y1) = (1,1), (x2,y2) = (2,2), and (x3,y3) = (x,y).

Substituting the values in the formula:

(2-1)(y-2) = (y-1)(x-2)

Simplifying the equation:

y - 4 = x - 2y + 2

Rearranging the terms:

x + y = 6

Therefore, all possible coordinates of (x,y) such that point (1,1), (2,2) & (x,y) are collinear are given by the equation x + y = 6.

4. Find out all possible values of a & b for which the ratio of a^3+b^3 to a^3-b^3 is 1:1 a,b are real numbers.

a3+b3 / a3-b3 = 1/1
Multiplying both sides by a3-b3:
a3+b3 = a3-b3
2b^3 = 0
b = 0
Substituting b = 0 in the original equation:
a^3 / a^3 = 1/1
a = ±1
Therefore, all possible values of a and b for which the ratio of a3+b3 to a3-b3 is 1:1 are given by (a,b) = (1,0) and (a,b) = (-1,0).

5. The triangle area formed by the lines y=x, y-axis and y=3 line will be?

The triangle area formed by the lines y=x, y-axis and y=3 line can be found by finding the intersection points of the lines. The intersection points are (0,0) and (3,3). Therefore, the base of the triangle is 3 units and the height of the triangle is 3 units. The area of the triangle is given by:

Area = 1/2 * base * height

Area = 1/2 * 3 * 3

Area = 4.5 square units

Therefore, the area of the triangle formed by the lines y=x, y-axis and y=3 line is 4.5 square units.
